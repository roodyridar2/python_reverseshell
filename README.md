# PentestReverseShell

Welcome to the PentestReverseShell repository! This project provides a Python-based reverse shell for penetration testing purposes.
The reverse shell allows you to take pictures from the target's webcam,
execute commands on the target system, and even provides a PowerShell script for executing arbitrary scripts.

## Features

1. **Reverse Shell:** Establish a connection to the target system, allowing you to interact with it remotely.
2. **Webcam Capture:** Capture pictures from the target's webcam to gather visual information.
3. **Command Execution:** Execute commands on the target system through the reverse shell.
4. **PowerShell Script:** Utilize a PowerShell script for executing arbitrary scripts on the target.
